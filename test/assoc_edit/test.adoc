|===

There are three types of association:  simple, ternary and super/subtype.
These are represented in the meta-model as subtypes of R_REL as R_SIMP,
R_ASSOC and R_SUPSUB.

The association editor can create new associations or edit existing
associations.  The dialogue needs to pre-populated correctly in both
cases.

Associations can be between different classes or the same class (reflexive).

Formalization of associations can involve various combinations of identifiers.
0, 1 or more than 1 identifier must be dealt with.  Also, the case of at
least one identifier in each participating class is interesting.

are identified and selected for test coverage.
